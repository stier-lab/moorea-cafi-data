## Study Overview

### Purpose
Compare physiological characteristics between two parts of coral branches (tip vs. base/stump)
to determine if tissue properties vary along the branch axis.

### Sample Origin
- **Original collection**: Summer 2019 (part of Neighborhood Survey)
- **Processing date**: December 2019
- **Storage**: Frozen at -80°C from Summer 2019 to December 2019
- **Source study**: Survey of Pocillopora neighborhoods and associated CAFI communities
  from three Moorea sites

**Additional context**:
See "Neighborhood Survey" sections in the Survey Study Overview documentation:

### Sample Processing
1. Thawed frozen branches
2. Fragmented into two parts: **tip** and **stump** (base)
3. Conducted physiological measurements on each fragment

## Study Motivation

### Primary Hypothesis
**Tip tissue is thinner than base tissue** due to new skeletal growth, which could lead to:
- Lower physiological measurements from tip fragments
- Bias if only tips are used for tissue analysis

### Alternative Hypothesis
**Base tissue has lower physiological activity** due to:
- Decreased sunlight exposure at branch base
- Potentially reduced energy exchange with symbiotic *Symbiodinium*

## Measurements Conducted

### 1. Protein Concentrations
**Purpose**: Test if physiology varies between branch parts

**Protocol**:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-KBlubSQE8Exh9UyYGwSATy4jvVO7dJF/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=103283395250523134119&rtpof=true&sd=true

**Data notes**:
- Some samples excluded from summary data due to contamination (noted in raw data)
- **Units**: Best estimate based on other protein measurements from survey and field
  experiment corals (raw data lacks unit labels)

### 2. Ash-Free Dry Weight (AFDW)
**Purpose**: Test if tissue thickness varies between tip and stump

**Protocol**:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LHV0ZH3yF1CKqAn4XWlZbSwpSg994wDb/view?usp=sharing

**Interpretation**:
- AFDW serves as proxy for tissue thickness
- Higher AFDW indicates more organic tissue mass

### 3. Surface Area (Wax-Dipping Method)
**Purpose**: Scale physiological measurements appropriately by surface area

**Protocol**:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h_czwMSYU3YWM7rL7c6u-MaJjKIWdfzB3uq1QfrR-3o/edit?usp=sharing

**Use**: Enables normalization of protein and AFDW measurements to tissue surface area

## Data Limitations and Notes

### Symbiodinium Counts (Not Available)
- **Original intent**: Compare *Symbiodinium* densities between tip and stump
- **Status**: Never measured adequately
- **Existing file**: One test file exists with no indication of whether from tip or stump
  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iS8XJuvPuhDVSEmP_hbVFBosGdgMU2IcGY4iFtUwhrA/edit?usp=sharing

### Protein Concentration Units
- **Uncertainty**: Raw data has no recorded units
- **Resolution**: Units inferred from other protein measurements in survey and field
  experiment datasets
- **Confidence**: Best estimate, not definitively confirmed

## Key Methodological Considerations

### Long-Term Storage
- 5-6 month storage at -80°C may affect tissue properties
- Consider potential freezer storage artifacts when interpreting results

### Branch Fragment Selection
- Tip: Terminal ~5cm of branch
- Stump: Basal portion near attachment point
- Clear spatial separation ensures distinct tissue zones

### Surface Area Normalization
- Critical for comparing physiological metrics between fragments of different sizes
- Wax-dipping method provides 3D surface area estimates
