# Maatea Size Experiment Overview

## Project Purpose
This experiment examined the effects of CAFI presence and community composition on coral
growth, survival, and physiology across a gradient of coral colony sizes.

## Timeline Overview
- **Initial deployment**: August 2019
- **Mid-experiment intervention**: December 2019
- **Final survey and breakdown**: May 2021
- **Total duration**: ~21 months

## Initial Deployment (August 2019)

### Coral Collection
- **Sample size**: n = 60 Pocillopora colonies
- **Collection site**: South shore backreef
- **Size range**: ~5-50cm diameter
- **Morphotypes**: 30 wide-branching, 30 tight-branching (evenly split)
- **Collection method**: Standard reef removal technique (see elsewhere for details)
- **Transport**: Via boat to experimental site

### Experimental Site
- **Location**: ~300m inshore of reef crest, just east of Atiha pass
- **Site preparation**: Corals transferred in sacks to sea floor before processing

### CAFI Removal Treatment (n = 30)
**Protocol** (abbreviated from standard field survey method):
1. Immersed colonies in eugenol solution for 1 minute (vs. 5 minutes in standard protocol)
2. Brief manual removal of remaining CAFI (<3 minutes)
3. Despite abbreviated protocol, effectively removed all visually evident CAFI, especially:
   - Larger crabs
   - Alpheid shrimps
   - Fishes

**CAFI preservation and measurement**:
- Preserved in 90% ethanol for identification within 72 hours
- Measured all CAFI from photographs in ImageJ

### Coral Attachment and Deployment
1. Attached corals to 20x20cm PVC plates using Z-Spar epoxy
2. Zip-tied each module to single 50x20cm cinder block
3. Random placement in 4 x 15 grid
4. Spacing: 5m between blocks
5. Total grid dimensions: 20m x 75m

### Post-Deployment Monitoring (72 hours)
Monitored and replaced any colony showing signs of:
- Tissue loss
- Partial mortality
- Excess paling

### Initial Measurements (Final Array)
1. **Tissue sampling**: Collected two nubbins (~5cm branch tips) per coral for
   physiological analysis
2. **Colony measurements**:
   - Manual measurements (standard field survey methods)
   - Photogrammetry (see detailed methods elsewhere)

## Mid-Experiment Survey (December 2019)

### Site Observations
Several corals, especially larger colonies, had tipped over and were partially buried in sand.

### Survey Protocol

#### 1. Fish Surveys
**Conducted before disturbing colonies**
- Observer positioned 2m from focal colony
- Watched for 1 minute
- Recorded abundance and identity of fish within 1m radius of coral
- Slowly circled colony at 2m distance
- Close inspection for cryptic individuals among branches

#### 2. Site Maintenance
- Righted all tipped colonies
- Added second cinder block to reinforce base of any coral >25cm diameter

#### 3. Coral Measurements
- Remeasured all colonies (manual and photogrammetry)
- Used same observers and equipment as initial deployment
- Noted percentage of live coral cover

### "Press" Treatment: Second CAFI Removal
**Motivation**: Dense fish swarms (particularly Chromis and Dascyllus spp.) had colonized
experimental colonies, including those in the CAFI removal treatment.

**In situ removal protocol** (minimally invasive):
1. Applied eugenol dilution (~10% v/v in seawater)
2. Vigorously flushed interstitial spaces with seawater
3. Captured anesthetized individuals with fine mesh nets
4. Manual inspection and removal with forceps of remaining CAFI
5. Second observer monitored for fleeing individuals

**Mechanical control**: Applied eugenol dilution to non-removal corals and prodded with
forceps to control for handling effects.

**CAFI processing**:
- Transferred captured individuals to labeled plastic bags on ice
- Counted and identified at Gump Research Station on day of capture
- Unidentified or unphotographed specimens frozen at -20°C for processing within 72 hours
- Measured all removed CAFI with calipers

**Second removal round**:
- Colonies rested for 72 hours after initial removal
- Repeated removal and CAFI surveys using same methods

**Coral health observations**:
- No mortality observed
- No tissue loss observed
- No extensive paling observed
- In situ removal and eugenol exposure well-tolerated

## Final Survey and Breakdown (May 2021)

### Survey Protocol
1. **Fish surveys**: Same methods as December 2019

2. **Coral measurements**:
   - Manual measurements
   - Photogrammetry
   - Same methods as December 2019

3. **Tissue sampling**: Collected two nubbins for final physiological analyses

4. **Colony removal and CAFI surveys**:
   - Light dosing with 10% v/v eugenol and seawater to sedate resident fishes
   - Wrapped each colony in polypropylene sack
   - Removed from experimental module
   - Transported in seawater to Gump Research Station
   - CAFI collection and surveys following standard field survey methods
   - Measured all CAFI from photographs with scale bars using ImageJ

## Key Methodological Notes

### CAFI Removal Effectiveness
- Abbreviated 1-minute eugenol protocol proved effective for removing visible CAFI
- Particularly successful for larger, mobile fauna

### In Situ Removal Innovation
- December 2019 protocol minimized stress by avoiding colony transport to surface
- Eugenol exposure and handling had no observable negative effects on coral health

### Fish Colonization
- Rapid colonization by planktivorous fishes (Chromis, Dascyllus) necessitated
  press treatment approach
- Demonstrates rapid habitat use by mobile fauna

### Measurement Consistency
- Same observers and equipment used across all time points when possible
- Ensures comparability across survey periods
