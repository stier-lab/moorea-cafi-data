# Survey Study Overview

## Project Purpose
This study examined connections between CAFI community composition and the availability
of nearby coral habitat by surveying focal Pocillopora colonies and measuring adjacent
coral colonies.

## Study Design

### Timing
June and July 2019

### Study Sites (3 locations on Moorea backreef)
1. **MRB**: Mid-North shore
2. **HAU**: Northern end of west shore
3. **MAT**: Southern end of east shore

### Coral Morphotypes (2 categories)
- **Tight-branching**: Generally similar to *P. verrucosa* and *P. meandrina*
- **Wide-branching**: Generally similar to *P. eydouxi*

### Sample Design
- **Per site**: n = 21 focal colonies
- **Morphotype distribution**: 10-11 wide-branching, 10-11 tight-branching
- **Total colonies surveyed**: 63 (across 3 sites)

### Focal Colony Selection Criteria
1. Clearly fit one of the two morphotypes
2. ~20-30cm in diameter
3. Positioned in location with:
   - Relatively even distribution of nearby Pocillopora habitat
   - Homogeneous terrain (not on top of a bommie)
4. Varied in degree of isolation from other Pocillopora colonies

### Environmental Context
- **Water depth**: 2-3m
- **Distance from reef crest**: 30-150m

## Field Methods

### Survey Protocol (conducted on SCUBA)

#### 1. Focal Colony Measurements
**Manual measurements with flexible tape:**
- **Length (L)**: Longest horizontal axis
- **Width (W)**: Longest perpendicular measurement to length
- **Height (H)**: Perpendicular to L and W
- **Circumference**: Colony circumference
- **Height above substrate**: Vertical distance from colony base to nearest reef pavement
  (for colonies above seafloor)

**Volume calculation:**
- Calculated as hemi-ellipsoid
- Previously validated method for relating Pocillopora spp. volume to CAFI biodiversity

#### 2. Neighborhood Survey (2m radius)
From center of focal colony, measured all Pocillopora colonies within 2m radius:
- Length, width, height (same metrics as focal colony)
- Circumference
- Height above substrate
- Hemi-ellipsoid volume
- **Horizontal distance** from focal coral base
- **Orientation** relative to reef crest

#### 3. Colony Collection
- Enclosed colonies in polypropylene sack to retain CAFI
- Removed coral at base using mallet and chisel
- Transported in collection sacks via boat to Gump Research Station in seawater buckets

## Laboratory Methods (Gump Research Station)

### Tissue Sampling
1. **Colony re-measurement**: Verified field measurements
2. **Nubbin collection**: Removed ~5cm sections from ends of two branches
   - Immediately frozen at -20°C for coral tissue property measurements
3. **Genetic sampling**: Collected 2 verrucae using sterilized cutters
   - Stored in 1mL RNA later at room temperature for genetic identification

### CAFI Extraction Protocol
1. **Anesthetic immersion**: Immersed corals in eugenol solution (100mg/L seawater)
   for 5 minutes
2. **Flushing**: Rapidly dunked colonies 5-10 times in eugenol solution
3. **Manual removal**: Used forceps to remove any remaining CAFI
4. **Isolation**: Poured eugenol solution through 1mm mesh and isolated visible CAFI

### CAFI Identification
**Timeline:**
- **Same-day identification**: When possible
- **Preserved specimens**: 90% ethanol for later identification (typically within 72 hours)

**Methods:**
- **Common, well-catalogued CAFI**: On-site identifications
- **Rare, small, or cryptic CAFI**: Photographed under dissecting microscope for
  future identification

**Reference materials:**
- Moorea Biocode
- UC Berkeley Cal Photos collection

**Taxonomic updates:**
- Nomenclature maintained and updated through January 2025
- Based on most recent accepted entry in World Registry of Marine Species (WoRMS)

### CAFI Measurements

**On-site specimens** (calipers):
- **Crabs**: Carapace width
- **Worms**: Total length
- **Snails**: Shell length
- **Fish**: Total length
- **Echinoderms**: Disc width
- **Shrimps, hermit crabs, squat lobsters**: Carapace length

**Microscope specimens** (ImageJ with scale bar):
- Unknown CAFI requiring photography

### Biomass Conversion
- **Fish**: Length-to-biomass conversion using relationships from FishBase
- **Invertebrates**: Length-weight relationships calculated from subset of individuals
  - Desiccated in drying oven at 60°C for 24 hours
  - Weighed after desiccation

## Size Survey (Supplementary Study)

### Purpose
Measure the relationship between CAFI community characteristics and coral colony size.

### Timing
July and August 2019

### Study Sites
Same three backreef sections as neighborhood survey (MRB, HAU, MAT)

### Sample Design
- **Per site**: 12-16 corals
- **Size range**: ~5-50cm diameter
- **Morphotypes**: Evenly split between wide- and tight-branching
- **Total**: 40-48 colonies across 3 sites

### Habitat Context Control
Selected focal corals from areas with:
- Consistent, moderate amounts of nearby Pocillopora habitat
- **Note**: Nearby habitat not explicitly surveyed (unlike neighborhood survey)
- Goal: Minimize variation in CAFI composition related to nearby colony abundance

### Methods
Identical CAFI collection, measurement, and identification methods as neighborhood survey.

## Key Methodological Notes

### Hemi-Ellipsoid Volume
Previously validated proxy for Pocillopora habitat volume and CAFI biodiversity.

### Measurement Consistency
- Same metrics used for focal and neighboring colonies
- Enables direct comparison of colony sizes within neighborhoods

### CAFI Preservation
Two-track approach balances:
- Speed of same-day identification (fresh specimens)
- Accuracy of preserved specimens for challenging taxa

### Taxonomic Rigor
- Reference to established Moorea collections
- Updated nomenclature ensures current taxonomic standards
- WoRMS as final authority on accepted names

### Habitat Context Differences
- **Neighborhood survey**: Explicitly measured nearby habitat
- **Size survey**: Controlled for habitat by site selection, no explicit measurement
