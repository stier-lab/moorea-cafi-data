# MRB Amount Project Overview

## Project Purpose
This experiment examined the effects of Pocillopora habitat density on CAFI (Coral-Associated
Fauna and Invertebrates) community assembly on the north shore backreef of Moorea.

## Experimental Setup

### Site Preparation (December 2019)
- **Location**: North shore backreef, ~200m inshore of reef crest near Maharepa township
- **Site dimensions**: 50m x 20m area
- **Preparation**: Removed coral rubble and large boulders to create uniform substrate

### Coral Collection
- **Source**: North shore forereef, ~10m water depth just outside Pao Pao Bay
- **Selection criteria**:
  - Intermediate size (~20-25cm diameter)
  - Intermediate branch spacing
- **Total colonies**: n = 54 corals

### Pre-Deployment Processing
1. Cleared all CAFI from corals using abbreviated boat-based removal method
2. Attached corals to 20x20cm PVC plates using Z-Spar marine epoxy
3. Mounted plates onto 40x50cm concrete bases (two parallel cinderblocks)

### Experimental Design

#### Density Treatments (3 levels)
- **Low Density (LD)**: Solitary corals, n = 18 replicates
- **Medium Density (MD)**: Groups of 3 corals, n = 6 replicates
- **High Density (HD)**: Groups of 6 corals, n = 3 replicates
- **Total colonies**: 18 LD + 18 MD (6×3) + 18 HD (3×6) = 54 corals

#### Spatial Arrangement
- **Array configuration**: 9 x 3 grid
- **Spacing between replicates**: 5m
- **Distribution per row**: 6 LD, 2 MD, 1 HD (randomly allocated)
- **MD arrangement**: Single-file row of 3, parallel to reef crest
- **HD arrangement**: Two adjacent rows of 3, parallel to reef crest
- **Distance between corals in clusters**: ~50cm

### Initial Measurements (December 2019)
- Manual measurements of all colonies
- Photogrammetry of each individual coral
- No tissue nubbins collected at deployment

## Follow-Up Survey (May 2021)

### Duration
17 months post-deployment

### Survey Protocol
1. **Fish surveys**:
   - Conducted first, before disturbing colonies
   - For clustered units, recorded all fish across constituent corals in single survey
   - Fish often moved between corals within clusters

2. **Coral measurements**:
   - Manual measurements
   - Photogrammetry

3. **Tissue sampling**:
   - Removed nubbins for physiological analysis

4. **CAFI surveys**:
   - Conducted at Gump Research Station
   - Combined on-site caliper measurements with ImageJ photography-based measurements
   - Excluded worms and very small individuals (<5mm) that would not appreciably
     contribute to per-colony CAFI biomass

## Key Methodological Notes
- CAFI were not retained or quantified during initial deployment clearing
- Multi-colony units surveyed as single observation during fish counts
- Measurement protocol optimized for larger CAFI contributing to biomass estimates
