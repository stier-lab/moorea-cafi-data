Subject: Re: BCO-DMO Dataset Submission (Adrian Stier - y8Vz5On33MEt0ZjJ)

Hi Shannon,

Thank you for the detailed guidance. I've prepared the materials you requested and would love to schedule a Zoom call to confirm the organization approach.

FILE DESCRIPTIONS:
I've created a file descriptions spreadsheet (BCO_DMO_FILE_DESCRIPTIONS_SIMPLE.csv) with unique descriptions for all 23 data files, including:
- Data type classification
- Brief description
- Primary vs supplemental designation
- Proposed BCO-DMO dataset assignment
- Row/column counts
- Related files

I can upload this to the submission portal or send it directly - whichever is easier.

PARAMETERS FILE:
I apologize for the confusion - I don't think the parameters file was successfully uploaded to the portal. I've now created BCO_DMO_MASTER_PARAMETERS.csv with definitions for all 203 unique parameters including units and which data files use each parameter. Would you prefer:
1. This master file covering all parameters, OR
2. Individual parameter files for each data file?

PROPOSED DATASET ORGANIZATION (3 Datasets):

Dataset 1: Biological Data
- Contents: CAFI taxonomy, coral physiology, fish surveys
- Primary files: 8
- Supplemental files: 2

Dataset 2: Coral Morphometry
- Contents: Photogrammetry, growth, colony measurements
- Primary files: 5
- Supplemental files: 4

Dataset 3: Experimental Design
- Contents: Treatment assignments, genetic samples
- Primary files: 3
- Supplemental files: 1

The three studies (Maatea Size, MRB Amount, Mo'orea Survey) remain identifiable within each dataset through filename prefixes and coral_id codes.

QUESTIONS FOR YOU:
1. Is this 3-dataset organization acceptable, or would you prefer a different structure?
2. Should I include the 12 species/field photos as a separate submission or as supplemental files?
3. I have 5 files in Excel format (all supplemental data) - should I convert these to CSV?

PHOTOS:
Yes, I do plan to submit the photos. I have 12 images (9 species specimens + 3 field/site documentation) with a complete image inventory including dates, coordinates, photographer, and WoRMS AphiaIDs for species photos.

ZOOM CALL:
A call would be very helpful to discuss the organization. I'm flexible on timing - please let me know what works for you.

Best regards,
Adrian
