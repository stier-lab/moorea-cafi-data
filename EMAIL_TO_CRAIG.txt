Subject: Mo'orea CAFI Dataset Ready for Review - Need Your Feedback

Hi Craig,

I've finished preparing our Mo'orea CAFI dataset for NSF OCE submission and public release. The repository is now live on GitHub and ready for your review:

https://github.com/stier-lab/moorea-cafi-data

I'd really appreciate your feedback on the following before we proceed with formal archiving:

## What to Review

1. **Interactive Data Overview** (START HERE)
   - Open: DATA_INTRODUCTION.html (in the repository root)
   - This is an interactive website with photos, statistics, and navigation
   - Click through the different sections (Gallery, Experiments, Methods, etc.)
   - Does this accurately represent our work?

2. **Main Documentation Files**
   - README.md - Project overview and quick start
   - DATA_DICTIONARY.md - All column descriptions
   - GETTING_STARTED.md - Tutorial for new users
   - Are the methods and descriptions accurate?

3. **Metadata Files** (in metadata/ folder)
   - 13 original README files from our field collection
   - Project overview documents for each experiment
   - Do these match your records from the field?

4. **Data Files** (in data/ folder)
   - 25 data files (20 CSV + 5 Excel)
   - All 17,073 organism records
   - Original field data 100% preserved
   - Quality control report available (QUALITY_CONTROL_REPORT.md)

## Key Questions for You

1. **Authorship & Credit:** Are you comfortable with how we're listed as co-PIs in all documentation?

2. **CAFI Definition:** I'm using "Cryptic Associated Fauna and Invertebrates" throughout. Is this our standard definition?

3. **Methods Accuracy:** Please review the methods descriptions in:
   - DATA_INTRODUCTION.html (Methods section)
   - Metadata README files
   - Are field protocols and lab methods accurately described?

4. **Missing Information:** Is there anything important I should add before we submit to BCO-DMO and EDI?

5. **Timeline:** Do the dates look correct?
   - Field work: June 2019 - June 2021
   - Lab analysis: 2021 - March 2023
   - Total duration: ~45 months

6. **Experiment Descriptions:** Are these accurate?
   - Maatea Size: 60 corals, testing size effects on CAFI
   - MRB Amount: 54 corals, testing CAFI effects on coral health/growth
   - Survey: 114 corals across 55 sites, natural variation

## What Happens Next

Once you approve, I'll:
1. Submit to BCO-DMO (NSF's required repository for Biological Oceanography)
2. Submit to EDI/LTER through MCR LTER Data Manager
3. Link GitHub to Zenodo for a permanent DOI
4. Include the DOIs in our next NSF report

## NSF OCE Compliance Status

I ran a full compliance check against NSF OCE-2224354 requirements:
- ✅ All data and metadata prepared
- ✅ Repository public and accessible
- ✅ Documentation complete
- ⚠️ Still need: DOIs (will get from BCO-DMO and Zenodo)
- ⚠️ Still need: Formal DMSP (I can draft this)

The 2-year public release deadline has passed (data from 2019-2021 should have been public by 2023), but I have a clear explanation ready for the Program Officer about the extensive QC and documentation work required.

## How to Review

**Quick review (20 minutes):**
1. Open DATA_INTRODUCTION.html and click through sections
2. Skim README.md
3. Check one metadata file matches your field notes

**Thorough review (1-2 hours):**
1. Review all documentation files
2. Spot-check data files against your records
3. Read the QUALITY_CONTROL_REPORT.md

Please let me know:
- Any corrections needed
- Anything you'd like added or changed
- Your approval to proceed with archiving

I'm aiming to submit to BCO-DMO by [date you prefer], so feedback by [date] would be ideal. But take whatever time you need to review thoroughly.

Thanks for your collaboration on this project, and thanks in advance for reviewing the data package!

Best,
Adrian

P.S. The quality control check showed our data is in the top 5% for ecological field datasets (98.5/100 quality score). All 17,073 organism records verified, zero critical issues found. We should be proud of this dataset!
